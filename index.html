          <p>This morning I woke up to dozens of messages from students who had read an article titled "Please Don't Learn to Code."</p>
          <p>At first, I assumed <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/">Jeff Atwood's 2012 article</a> had spontaneously reappeared on Reddit. But no - this was a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/please-dont-learn-to-code"> brand new Tech Crunch article</a> of the same name, which echoed Atwood's assertion that encouraging everyone to learn programming is like encouraging everyone to learn plumbing.</p>
          <p>Here's why programming - unlike plumbing - is an important skill that everyone should learn: <strong>programming is how humans talk to machines.</strong></p>
